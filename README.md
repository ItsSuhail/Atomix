# Atomix
Atomix is an interactive learning environment (ILE), designed to ameliorate student's chemistry knowledge. The game takes inspiration from tetris, where the user is provided an incomplete chemical reaction and is supposed to collect correct "atoms" / "elements" in the right order to complete the chemical reaction.

This project was submitted as our team's final year CS project, where we were supposed to use python to create something valuable and impactful.

## Project components:
+ sqllite database
+ chemical compounds parsing
+ background images and fonts
+ Babloo Management system
+ background music and sound effects

We have used sqllite to manage our database, which consists of elements, compounds and chemical reactions. Background images and fonts have been used to create an interactive GUI.
A Babloo Management system is an important part of the project which deals with spawning "Babloos" which are in layman terms, "bubbles" containing "atoms" / "elements" which fall from above and are to be collected using a "conical flask"
